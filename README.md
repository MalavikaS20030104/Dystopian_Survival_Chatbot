Project Description
The Dystopian Survival Chatbot is an interactive web-based application designed to assist users in a dystopian survival scenario. 
The chatbot provides survival tips and answers critical questions related to food, water, shelter, and safety. 
This chatbot is powered by a Flask backend that communicates with the Google Gemini API to generate meaningful responses based on user input.

Features:
Interactive Chat: The chatbot allows users to interact with it by typing questions related to survival scenarios.
Survival Tips: Based on user input, the bot provides survival tips regarding food, water, shelter, and environmental conditions (e.g., storms, rain).
Google Gemini Integration: The bot's responses are powered by Google's Gemini API, ensuring that it generates realistic and contextually appropriate responses.
Real-time Communication: The app uses JavaScript's fetch function to communicate with the Flask backend and display bot responses in real-time.

The Problem statement
Imagine facing a dystopian situation. People become really confused about the then-present scenarios as it makes them difficult to live each and every moment.
The Solution
he Dystopian Survival Chatbot is here to save your fictional life when the world goes sideways! 
Whether youâ€™re looking for food, water, shelter, or just some advice on avoiding mutant storms, 
this chatbot has you covered. Built with a Flask backend and powered by the all-knowing Google Gemini API, 
it delivers witty and useful survival tips in real-time. Just type your panic-stricken questions, 
and itâ€™ll provide you with the best advice, like "Donâ€™t eat that, it's probably a trap" or 
"Stay away from tall trees in a stormâ€”unless youâ€™re a fan of getting struck by lightning."
A little humor, a lot of survival tipsâ€”just in case you need them when things get apocalyptic!

Implementation
For Software:
For Software:

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

HTML: Creates the structure with a heading and input field for user questions.
CSS: Styles the chat interface for an engaging user experience.
JavaScript: Sends user input to the Flask backend via a POST request, displays bot responses, and ensures smooth scrolling in the chatbox.
Backend (Flask):

The Flask app handles incoming user questions on the /message endpoint and communicates with the Google Gemini API to generate context-aware survival advice.
Flask-CORS enables cross-origin requests, allowing the frontend to connect to the backend even from different origins.
Google Gemini API:

Powers the chatbot by generating survival tips based on user input, such as "Look for non-perishable food like canned goods."
Communication Flow:

User types a question â†’ Frontend sends it to Flask â†’ Flask forwards it to the Gemini API â†’ Response sent back to frontend and displayed.
Error Handling:

The backend catches errors (e.g., API issues) and sends a fallback message, while the frontend shows the error if the backend is unreachable.
